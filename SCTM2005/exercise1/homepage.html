    <h1>WELCOME TO COCO'S PAGE:></h1>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Sinuo Li, but I prefer that others call me Coco. I am currently a 4th year student in the OCAD University's Graphic Design program. I only have a bit background in programming and HTML/CSS by just finished the Graphic Design 2 class which is related to coding. I had learnt how to build a website by using HTML and CSS, but I am not familiar to how to make animation by coding. So hopefully I can develop more coding skills in SCTM 2005 class.
    </p>

        For my homepage, I am showing some of my recent packaging design projects where I experiment with different illustrator techniques to create designs. I am passionate about exploring different design styles and techniques. I like to draw inspiration from life and incorporate beautiful elements of reality into my work. I have worked individually or participated in the design of multiple packaging design projects, including designing brand identities, etc. These experiences improved my design skills and developed my ability to communicate and collaborate with a team. In my daily life, I love to play video games with my friends, such as Glory of Kings.
